(Actual) Architecture

  This page gives an overview over the actual architecture of the OpenEngSB project. Since the OpenEngSB is actually in quite
 a very early stage only outlines of the architecture are presented which should be refined in the next weeks and
 fixed in a detailed architectural description of the system. Because the images are too big for the browser only
 the link on them is given here.

  The following pictures presents an overview over the entire system, the core components, the domains and the
 communication between two OpenEngSBs via a gateway module.

  This outline presents a more detailed view on the design of a single tool-domain and shows in detail the different
 parts a tool domain is build of and how these parts are connected.

  The workflow descriptions gives a textual overview over the typical workflow in the OpenEngSB between core components
 and additional components. Further more also the workflow component, the complex event processing component
 and additional core components and domains are included.

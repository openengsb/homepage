          The service integration tutorial shows how to combine and
          automate different software tools, services and
          applications with OpenEngSB. To show OpenEngSB's
          versatility the use case we will be implementing is a
          continuous integration (CI) tool for software development
          processes. The tutorial takes a straight forward approach
          favoring visible results over architectural details of
          tool integration. Whether or not you have experience with
          CI, bear with the tutorial for a moment and you will see
          how simple it works out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we get started let us lay out the idea of our CI
          tool and create a step-by-step development plan. The
          practice of continuous integration aims at improving
          software quality by frequent (automated) building and
          testing of a project's source base and by reporting back
          to the developers. The CI tool must be able to access the
          source repository, build the project, test the binaries
          and reports to the developers. And there we have a basic
          four step plan:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Repository access
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Building source
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Testing binaries
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Notification process
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to take a look at a fully functional CI
          server built on OpenEngSB check out <a class="link" href="http://opencit.openengsb.org" target="_top">OpenCIT</a>. It implements a wider range of
          features, but it's a great reference.

          Getting OpenEngSB is simple. Go to <a class="link" href="http://www.openengsb.org" target="_top">openengsb.org</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.openengsb.org/downloads.html" target="_top">download</a> the latest stable version to
          your computer and unpack the archive to a convenient
          location. Before you fire up OpenEngSB for the first
          time, please make sure you have a Java Development Kit
          1.6+ available and set up.

          You can startup OpenEngSB via the <span class="command"><b>openengsb</b></span> script
          in the &quot;bin&quot; folder. If you want to explore the web
          interface yourself before digging into implementing the
          CI use case, open up your web browser and navigate to <a class="link" href="http://localhost:8090/openengsb" target="_top">http://localhost:8090/openengsb</a> and log
          on as &quot;admin&quot; with password &quot;password&quot;.

          If you want to take a break or shutdown OpenEngSB in the
          middle of the tutorial, go ahead and do not worry. All
          changes made so far are saved and restored upon restart,
          so you can continue working with the most up-to-date
          state. Use the <span class="command"><b>shutdown</b></span> command
          in OpenEngSB's management console to stop any running

          It turns out, we actually need a sample project before we
          can start developing and testing our CI tool. In this
          tutorial we will be using Apache Maven for project and
          source management and a small <span class="command"><b>Hello World</b></span>
          application written in Java. For this to work flawlessly
          we need JDK 1.6+ (<a class="link" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_top">download</a>) and Maven 3+ (<a class="link" href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html" target="_top">download</a>) to be set up on the computer.

          You could certainly build the project using Maven, but we
          want this to happen from within OpenEngSB. Open up your
          browser and go to the web interface at <a class="link" href="http://localhost:8090/openengsb" target="_top">http://localhost:8090/openengsb</a>.
          Authenticate using the <span class="command"><b>Login</b></span> link as
          &quot;admin&quot; with password &quot;password&quot;.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_testclient.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            test client
          
        
        <p>
          Switch to the <span class="command"><b>Test
          client</b></span> tab and check whether the <span class="command"><b>build domain</b></span> is
          available to accept commands.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_feature.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            install connector in console
          
        
        <p>
          As the <span class="command"><b>build
          domain</b></span> is not shown, we will need to go
          to OpenEngSB's console. Use the &quot;features:install
          openengsb-connector-maven&quot; command to load the tool
          connector for Apache Maven. The tool connector allows
          OpenEngSB to communicate with an external service or
          application, Maven in this case. By loading the connector
          OpenEngSB also loads the domains associated with the
          connector. A domain is a generic interface that is
          implemented by specific connectors. For example, the
          build domain offers a generic function to build a
          software project. Whether this is done by Apache Maven,
          an Ant script or a plain compiler depends on the
          connector chosen by the user, but does not affect the
          basic model of our CI tool that simply &quot;builds&quot; the
          source. Using this technique specific tools can be
          exchanged quickly and transparently while data-flow and
          process models are completely unaffected.

            create new connector instance
          
        
        <p>
          Now let us return to the web interface. After a page
          refresh we are able to create a new Maven connector
          instance by following the <span class="command"><b>new</b></span> link next to
          the connector description.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_buildconnector.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            setup build connector
          
        
        <p>
          The service id is an arbitrary name that can be referred
          to later on, i.e. <span class="command"><b>builder</b></span>. The
          project path refers to the local copy of the source
          repository, i.e. &quot;/home/user/Desktop/openengsb-tutorial&quot;.
          Finally, the maven command is the command line option
          handed to Apache Maven, i.e. &quot;clean build&quot;. Whenever the
          connector is ordered to build the project it will now
          execute &quot;mvn clean compile&quot; in the project directory of
          openengsb-tutorial. Click save to create the connector
          instance.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_testbuilder.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            test build connector
          
        
        <p>
          It is time for some action. Scroll down all the way in
          the <span class="command"><b>Test
          Client</b></span> tab, navigate to the <span class="command"><b>BuildDomain</b></span> in
          the tree view and click the <span class="command"><b>builder</b></span> service.
          From the drop down menu below select <span class="command"><b>build()</b></span> and click
          the &quot;Call&quot; button. When the project is built successfully
          a &quot;Method called successfully&quot; message appears.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_helloworld.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            hello world
          
        
        <p>
          Let us check the directory of openengsb-tutorial to find
          the newly created <span class="command"><b>target</b></span> directory.
          Using a console we can navigate to the <span class="command"><b>classes</b></span>
          sub-folder and run &quot;java org.openengsb.Main&quot;. It returns
          &quot;Hello World!&quot;. Congratulations, you have just
          implemented the core functionality of our CI tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case an error message is returned, we need to check
          the connector configuration. Please make sure that Maven
          is able to build the project by manually executing &quot;mvn
          clean build&quot; in the project directory of
          openengsb-tutorial. If this does not work out, most
          likely the setup of either Maven or JDK are incorrect. If
          it works however, please check the configuration of the
          connector by navigating to the <span class="command"><b>builder</b></span> service
          in the web interface again and clicking the &quot;Edit
          Service&quot; button.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next step in building the CI tool is implementation
          of automated testing. We can use the <span class="command"><b>test domain</b></span> to
          achieve this. Conveniently, the Maven connector also
          exports this type of functionality and we do not to load
          any additional features in the management console.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_testconnector.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            setup test connector instance
          
        
        <p>
          Use the <span class="command"><b>Test
          client</b></span> tab and create a new instance of
          the Maven connector for the &quot;test&quot; domain. It works the
          same way as before. The Service Id is an arbitrary name,
          i.e. <span class="command"><b>tester</b></span>. The
          project path points at the location of
          openengsb-tutorial's base directory, i.e.
          &quot;/home/user/Desktop/openengsb-tutorial&quot;, and the maven
          command indicates the command line arguments passed to
          Maven, i.e. &quot;test&quot;. Click save to create the connector
          instance.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_testtester.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            test test connector (yes, that's necessary)
          
        
        <p>
          We are also going to test the newly created connector.
          Use the tree view at the bottom of the page to navigate
          to <span class="command"><b>TestDomain</b></span> and
          select the <span class="command"><b>tester</b></span> service.
          In the drop down box below choose <span class="command"><b>runTests()</b></span> and
          click the &quot;Call&quot; button. If the &quot;method called
          successfully&quot; message is returned, the Maven connector
          ran the rigorous unit tests on our sample application and
          they were passed with flying colors.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_sendeventpage.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            send event page
          
        
        <p>
          In case you are wondering about the output of the test
          suite go to the <span class="command"><b>Send Event
          page</b></span>. There you will find an audit list
          of all events processed by OpenEngSB and their
          corresponding payload, i.e. the output of the test run.
          The list behaves like a log file with most recent events
          appended to the bottom. In OpenEngSB any input from
          connectors is processed by domains and packaged in form
          of events. Every time an event is raised it can be
          matched by a rule in a central rule-base and cause a
          reaction of the system possibly invoking different
          domains or spawning additional events. By editing the
          rule-base we become able to link different actions
          together. Depending on the outcome of an action, we may
          receive different events, i.e. build success or build
          failure. By creating separate rules for each case we can
          react accordingly and by chaining multiple actions and
          events we could create a longer decision tree or process
          model.
        </p>

                Notification Process
              <a name="a12.8.Step_4_-________________Notification_Process"></a></h2>
            
          
        
        <p>
          In the final step we link the build and test stages
          together and add functionality to output results of the
          process. For this purpose we will create a small number
          of rules that react to events generated by the build and
          test stage. To keep things simple we do not add further
          connectors and assume that the build process is started
          by calling the <span class="command"><b>builder</b></span>'s
          &quot;build()&quot; method in the <span class="command"><b>Test client</b></span> web
          UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are going to write the results of the build and test
          stage to the management console of OpenEngSB. We will
          notify about the build starting and its outcome. Also, in
          case the build works out successfully we will
          automatically start the test process. Hence, we need
          rules matching &quot;BuildStartEvent&quot; and &quot;BuildSuccessEvent&quot;
          that write output to the console and potentially activate
          the test connector.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_ruleeditor.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            rule base editor
          
        
        <p>
          The easiest way to edit the rule-base of our OpenEngSB
          instance is the editor area at the bottom of the <span class="command"><b>Send Event page</b></span>.
          You can find event types and names by checking the event
          log displayed on the page and create rules manually in
          the editor below. The rules are written in plain text,
          based on Drools (<a class="link" href="http://www.jboss.org/drools/documentation" target="_top">documentation</a>) and Java standards. They
          are quickly understood, just take a look at the <span class="command"><b>auditEvent</b></span> rule
          used to generate the event log displayed on top of the
          page. You can display the rule by choosing &quot;Rule&quot; in the
          left-most drop-down box and &quot;org.openengsb.auditEvent&quot; in
          the second one. The text editor now shows that there is a
          <span class="command"><b>when</b></span>
          section that acts as filter for incoming events and there
          is a <span class="command"><b>then</b></span>
          section that describes the actions to be taken in case of
          a match.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_buildrule.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            build started rule
          
        
        <p>
          Let us start out and create our own rule. We will inform
          the user via console when a build process starts. Click
          the <span class="command"><b>new</b></span>
          button next to the drop-down boxes, enter a name for the
          newly created rule, i.e. &quot;buildStarted&quot;, and save it.
          After selecting the rule in the drop-down box the text
          editor actually shows the same content as for the audit
          event. Do not be confused, it's the default template. You
          can start editing right away. <span class="command"><b>Note</b></span>: Writing
          output directly to the console without using a logger
          service is considered bad practice. Yet, it's simple and
          sufficient for demonstration purposes.
        </p>
<div class="programlisting"><pre>
    
when
  Event(type == &quot;BuildStartEvent&quot;)
then
  System.out.println(&quot;Build started&quot;);
   
</pre></div>
        <p>
          This rule matches &quot;BuildStartEvent&quot; and prints a line to
          the console window. Click <span class="command"><b>save</b></span> to prepare
          the rule for testing. Switch to the <span class="command"><b>Test client</b></span> tab,
          select the <span class="command"><b>builder</b></span> and call
          the &quot;build()&quot; method. If things work out, you'll
          instantly see the &quot;Build started&quot; notification pop up in
          the management console.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's time to push this further. Create another rule, i.e.
          &quot;buildSuccessful&quot; and edit it to look like this:
        </p>
<div class="programlisting"><pre>
    
when
  Event(type == &quot;BuildSuccessfulEvent&quot;)
then
  System.out.println(&quot;Build successful, running tests&quot;);
  tester.runTests();
   
</pre></div>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><b>Note</b></span>: as of
          OpenEngSB 1.1.2 there is a bug in the editor that
          prevents connector invocations
          (&quot;connectorId.doSomething()&quot;) from working correctly.
        </p>
        
          <img src="graphics/ci_consoleoutput.png" align="middle" alt="" />
          
            console output
          
        
        <p>
          The rule also matches &quot;BuildSuccessEvent&quot; and prints a
          line to the console window. In addition, however, it
          calls a method provided by the test connector. Remember
          the &quot;runTests()&quot; method you called in the <span class="command"><b>tester</b></span> service by
          using the test client before? This has exactly the same
          effect but replaces manual UI interaction with an
          automated response. Click <span class="command"><b>save</b></span> and kick off
          another build using the <span class="command"><b>Test client</b></span>
          again. There you go: &quot;Build started&quot; and &quot;Build
          successful, running tests&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="command"><b>Congratulations</b></span>,
          you have created a basic CI tool! The foundations have
          been extended to allow for easy auditing and
          extensibility. Of course, at the moment it simply
          replicates the functionality of existing CI tools, but it
          can be easily extended using SCM access, reporting and
          notification tools and work together with project
          management software and PIM applications. Take a look on
          the long list of available domains and tool connectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to do some more practice you can add more
          rules, i.e. for &quot;TestSuccessEvent&quot; or
          &quot;BuildFailureEvent&quot;. You can find event types, names and
          properties by checking the event log displayed on the
          <span class="command"><b>Send Event
          page</b></span>.

    <faq id="why">
      <question>Why is OpenEngSB developed as open-source project?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          OpenEngSB is developed as a FOSS (Free and open-source software)
          project to provide developers with a transparent and adaptable
          framework for integration of engineering tools. As usual for
          successful plattforms in heterogeneous systems open source-access
          allows developers to directly review and adapt the base framework
          to their needs. Closed-source licenses do not provide this kind of
          freedom and prevent framework users from doing what is best for their
          project. OpenEngSB uses the liberal Apache License 2.0 and ensures
          sustained transparency.

    <faq id="platforms">
      <question>What platforms does OpenEngSB support?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          OpenEngSB is written in Java entirely which makes it platform
          independent and made a broad variety of plattforms prominent among
          developers and users. Typically used are Debian-Linux distributions,
          Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. This way OpenEngSB's plattform
          independence is actively tested on a regular basis.

    <faq id="support">
      <question>How long will my OpenEngSB-version be supported?</question>
        <answer>
          <p>Short answer is: 3 months active support followed by 3 months passive support, starting from the day the
          major version was released.
          "Active support" means that all bugs are evaluated if they affect development and/or the stable version
          and bufixes are backported accordingly. Also minor new features are included in future minor releases.
          "Passive support" means that bugs are only fixed when explicitly reported for this version. Also future
          minor releases will not contain any new features.</p>
          <p>Example:
          1.1.0.RELEASE was released 2011-03-08. 1.1.2.RELEASE was released 2011-03-22. Active support for 1.1.x will end 2011-06-08.
          After that bugs will be fixed on demand until 2011-09-08.</p>
          <p>Exactly the same model is used for all other projects located at github.com/openengsb/, including
          connectors, domains and other subprojects.</p>
          Due to limited resources, the community cannot offer further support for older versions.

      <question>Can I debug OpenEngSB with source-code?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Yes. The moment you startup the OpenEngSB using "maven
          openengsb:provision" (or one of the scripts using this command, such
          as the run script) you can attach a remote debugger to localhost:5005
          (from Eclipse, or any other IDE of your choice). That's it.

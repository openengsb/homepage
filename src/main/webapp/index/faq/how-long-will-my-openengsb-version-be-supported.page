h4. How long will my OpenEngSB-version be supported?

Short answer is: 3 months active support followed by 3 months passive support, starting from the day the major version was released. "Active support" means that all bugs are evaluated if they affect development and/or the stable version and bufixes are backported accordingly. Also minor new features are included in future minor releases. "Passive support" means that bugs are only fixed when explicitly reported for this version. Also future minor releases will not contain any new features.

Example: 1.1.0.RELEASE was released 2011-03-08. 1.1.2.RELEASE was released 2011-03-22. Active support for 1.1.x will end 2011-06-08. After that bugs will be fixed on demand until 2011-09-08.

Exactly the same model is used for all other projects located at github.com/openengsb/, including connectors, domains and other subprojects.
Due to limited resources, the community cannot offer further support for older versions.

h4. Can I debug OpenEngSB with source-code?

Yes. The moment you startup the OpenEngSB using "maven openengsb:provision" (or one of the scripts using this command, such as the run script) you can attach a remote debugger to localhost:5005 (from Eclipse, or any other IDE of your choice). That's it.

h4. What are the future plans?

The OpenEngSB has it's roots in the [research area|http://cdl.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/] and as such various questions arise:
* What is the current goal of the OpenEngSB project?
* Is it completely standalone, or is research still the focus? 

Research is and will always be a focus of the OpenEngSB. We want to research and figure out how an ESB has to look like to allow the best off-the-shelf semantic and application integration. We focus on questions of model versioning, model integration, distributed models and various other things in the semantic area. In addition the integration of Rich-Client-Tools (could go on/off any time, need tighter integrations with people in front of them; this also includes the integration of people into workflows and more complex process/event handling) is a goal. So there will always be research (since most of our financial resources are given to us for research). Still we've many experienced engineers here with a deep dedication to opensource, so you'll never get the feeling of a crappy science prototype when using the OpenEngSB. In addition we prepare resources, homepage, documentation to become an apache podling project within the next year making a clear statement that we want the OpenEngSB to be an own product, independent of the CDL-Flex.

h1. Road to Apache

The overall plan is to get the OpenEngSB to Apache. Therefore the following tasks needs to be full filled.

* \[[OPENENGSB-2581|http://issues.openengsb.org/jira/browse/OPENENGSB-2581]\] Provide quickstart documentation and implementation for simple and advanced use cases. (April, 2012)
* \[[OPENENGSB-2688|http://issues.openengsb.org/jira/browse/OPENENGSB-2688]\] Present quickstart on homepage. (April, 2012)
* \[[OPENENGSB-2885|http://issues.openengsb.org/jira/browse/OPENENGSB-2885]\] Provide a Apache Proposal (May 2012)
* Proposal discussion, mentor finding, and hopefully successful vote to incubator (June, 2012)
* Update project to ASF guidelines, namespaces, licenses, ... (July, 2012)
* Incubator release 1.0 (August, 2012)
* Community building and further releases to become a TLP (April, 2012)

h2. Semantic Integration

h3. Datastorage (EDB)
* (Virtual)Multiple EDBs
* Hooks
* similarity checker

h3. Knowledgebase Backend
* sanity-check
* <3.0.0> Linking (APIB)
* model & vertices persistence (JPA)
* graphDB (in-memory, only representation & navigation/search, node types (model & transformation), own implementation for now)
* queries (against EDB information)
* queries (against domains(/tools))
* transformation
* merge
* code generation from model/model generation from code
* engineering objects

h1.  Administration UI
* query UI  
* dashboard
* split into modules (Pages->Panels->Services) (APIB)
* build on top of karaf-webconsole
* editing of nodes (models) and vertices (transformations)
* <3.0.0> make more usable

h1. Developer Support (IDE-Integration)

h2. basic features in various languages (java, c#, c++ for the beginning)
* setup and basic feature
* Development-package (download & start + bridge integration)

h2. Enduser Design IDE
* Define typical node-patterns (e.g. call method x on domain y, transform/merge/query result to model z)
  - Pave the way for workflow-editor

* Workfloweditor (eclipse)
  * code-generation
  * validation
  * Testing
  * human tasks Helpers (IDE)
* Script Editor

h2. supported connector ides
* eclipse, VS, (#D)
* Java Bridge
* .NET Bridge (C#)
* c++ bridge

h1. Research
* Evaluation: Camel vs. Drools

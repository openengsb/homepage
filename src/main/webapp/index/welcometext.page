<h1>Welcome to OpenEngSB!</h1>

<p>
The Open Engineering Service Bus (OpenEngSB) project provides an easy-to-use and easy-to-adapt platform for tool integration. It offers graphical workflow design between software tools and avoids repetitive setup tasks. In contrast to typical Enterprise Service Bus approaches existing workflows can easily be adapted to software changes due to the domain-based integration model. Thus, OpenEngSB enables transparency in dynamic development processes too and frees the engineers' time for productive work.

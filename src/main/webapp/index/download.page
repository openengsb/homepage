h1. Downloads

OpenEngSB comes in two flavors as it is under active development. Stable releases and development builds.

If you're looking to deploy OpenEngSB on scale you'll likely want to use the stable release. If you require newest features and performance improvements the development version is yours. The development version is considered stable, you might encounter minor issues however.

In addition we provide fully bundled servers and connectors and frameworks separated for download. While the fully bundled server is the "easy to go" solution the framework itself can be configured and optimized in detail.

h2. OpenEngSB Bundles

While the OpenEngSB Framework is the base of the OpenEngSB the OpenEngSB Bundle is a package of the framework, all connectors, examples and the documentation in one big bundle. All bundles in all versions are available [for download here|https://github.com/openengsb/openengsb/downloads]. For the latest bundle download openengsb-bundle-1.2.2.RELEASE_X.zip. For the development version download openengsb-bundle-1.3.0.M3_X.zip. All bundles are multiplatform ready and automatically start all connectors, domains and features at startup.

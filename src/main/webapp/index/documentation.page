The usermanual contains descriptions about how to use the OpenEngSB and how to configure it. Further more information for starting with the development of connectors and domains are contained. It is thought as well for users who simply want to try the OpenEngSB as for developer like to integrate tool connectors. The introduction of the user manual should be read by all and provide additional information which chapters are interesting for which target audience.

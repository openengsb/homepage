# FAQ

### General questions about the OpenEngSB 

<a href="#" id="faq1">What is OpenEngSB?</a>
<div id="faqtext1">
A short introduction can be found <a href="/index/description.html">here</a>. For further information please consult the <a href="/index/documentation.html">user manual</a>. 
</div>

<a href="#" id="faq2">When to use the OpenEngSB?</a>
<div id="faqtext2" >
The OpenEngSB is an ESB, but with a little different purpose than other systems.

The OpenEngSB consists of: 
<ul>
<li>Felix</li> 
<li>Karaf</li>
<li>CXF</li>
<li>AMQ</li>
<li>Drools</li>
<li>Own Components</li>
<li>Domains</li> 
<li>Connectors</li>
</ul>

Typical ESB go the approach: here you've your base system (e.g. Karaf when using OSGi or any other non-OSGi-base-system), CXF, AMQ, Camel; and now do what you want. This approach is really good if you have almost only server components and wire the entire thing together only once and exactly for your needs. If this is exactly what you need, you might be better off with SMX (or a similar product). 
<br />
BUT in case you need to integrate rich client tools, the people themselves working with these tools (we've advanced workflow support for human interaction) and their processes; and at best want to reuse this for various customers the OpenEngSB is your tool of choice.
<br />
Or in other words the more concepts of the OpenEngSB you use the more you get from it.
</div>

<a href="#" id="faq3">Why is OpenEngSB developed as open-source project?</a>
<div id="faqtext3" >
OpenEngSB is developed as a FOSS (Free and open-source software) project to provide developers with a transparent and adaptable framework for integration of engineering tools. As usual for successful plattforms in heterogeneous systems open source-access allows developers to directly review and adapt the base framework to their needs. Closed-source licenses do not provide this kind of freedom and prevent framework users from doing what is best for their project. OpenEngSB uses the liberal Apache License 2.0 and ensures sustained transparency.
</div>

<a href="#" id="faq4">What is the current status with users of the OpenEngSB?</a>
<div id="faqtext4" >
Well, once there is no more work to do a software is dead :-)
<br />
As you might see on <a href="https://github.com/openengsb">github.com/openengsb</a> there is a lot of work going on into various projects. And as we get more and more feedback from adopters there are also interface changes. So there are and will be interface changes between major versions (and only between them; none in minor and micros; we believe in semantic versioning). 
<br />
With that said some words to the usage in live projects. We've a commercial product based on the OpenEngSB named LogiASB. Well, basically this is the OpenEngSB with domains, tools and workflows specific for the creation of water power plants. They wire their tools, data and engineers together controlling and supporting the development process over those multi-discipline tools. We've three instances at various customers running and also working together with various tool creators to provide support for the OpenEngSB/LogiASB. So, the OpenEngSB is in use at various big customers, but to stay honest, it has not (yet) the distribution as other busses like SMX, Mule, ...

<a href="#" id="faq5">Where can I find help?</a>
<div id="faqtext5" >
The <a href="/index/documentation.html">user manual</a> contains basic information about the OpenEngSB. For further information please contact the respective <a href="/index/infrastructure/mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a> available. 
</div>

<a href="#" id="faq6">What platforms does OpenEngSB support?</a>
<div id="faqtext6" >
OpenEngSB is written in Java entirely which makes it platform independent and made a broad variety of plattforms prominent among developers and users. Typically used are Debian-Linux distributions, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. This way OpenEngSB's plattform independence is actively tested on a regular basis. 
</div>

<a href="#" id="faq7">What are the future plans of the OpenEngSB?</a>
<div id="faqtext7" >
The OpenEngSB has it's roots in the <a href="http://cdl.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/">research area</a> and as such various questions arise:

<ul>
<li>What is the current goal of the OpenEngSB project?</li>
<li>Is it completely standalone, or is research still the focus?</li>
</ul>

Research is and will always be a focus of the OpenEngSB. We want to research and figure out how an ESB has to look like to allow the best off-the-shelf semantic and application integration. We focus on questions of model versioning, model integration, distributed models and various other things in the semantic area. In addition the integration of Rich-Client-Tools (could go on/off any time, need tighter integrations with people in front of them; this also includes the integration of people into workflows and more complex process/event handling) is a goal. So there will always be research (since most of our financial resources are given to us for research). Still we've many experienced engineers here with a deep dedication to opensource, so you'll never get the feeling of a crappy science prototype when using the OpenEngSB. In addition we prepare resources, homepage, documentation to become an apache podling project within the next year making a clear statement that we want the OpenEngSB to be an own product, independent of the CDL-Flex.

<a href="#" id="faq8">What license is used?</a>
<div id="faqtext8" >
OpenEngSB is licensed under the business friendly open-source Apache License, Version 2.0. 
</div>

<a href="#" id="faq9">Where can I find the source code?</a>
<div id="faqtext9" >
The source code is available at GitHub (<a href="http://github.com/openengsb/openengsb">http://github.com/openengsb/openengsb</a>). For more information see <a href="/index/infrastructure/source.html">source repository</a>.
</div>

<a href="#" id="faq10">Where can I file a bug report or feature request?</a>
<div id="faqtext10" >
<a href="/index/infrastructure/issue-tracker.html">Here</a> is information about our issue tracking process. Please feel free to let us know about any bugs, issues or other problems you encounter. We are especially happy about feedback regarding the documentation of the OpenEngSB project. If you have ideas on improving OpenEngSB please contact us via the <a href="/index/infrastructure/mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>. 
</div>

<a href="#" id="faq11">How long will my OpenEngSB-version be supported?</a>
<div id="faqtext11" >
Short answer is: 3 months active support followed by 3 months passive support, starting from the day the major version was released. "Active support" means that all bugs are evaluated if they affect development and/or the stable version and bufixes are backported accordingly. Also minor new features are included in future minor releases. "Passive support" means that bugs are only fixed when explicitly reported for this version. Also future minor releases will not contain any new features.
<br />
Example: 1.1.0.RELEASE was released 2011-03-08. 1.1.2.RELEASE was released 2011-03-22. Active support for 1.1.x will end 2011-06-08. After that bugs will be fixed on demand until 2011-09-08.
<br />
Exactly the same model is used for all other projects located at github.com/openengsb/, including connectors, domains and other subprojects.
Due to limited resources, the community cannot offer further support for older versions.

### Development

<a href="#" id="faq12">How can I contribute to the OpenEngSB project?</a>
<div id="faqtext12" >
If you have an idea how the OpenEngSB can be improved please contact us on the developer <a href="/index/infrastructure/mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>. Further information can be found <a href="/index/contribute.html">here</a>. 
</div>

<a href="#" id="faq13">Can I debug OpenEngSB with source-code?</a>
<div id="faqtext13" >
Yes. The moment you startup the OpenEngSB using "maven openengsb:provision" (or one of the scripts using this command, such as the run script) you can attach a remote debugger to localhost:5005 (from Eclipse, or any other IDE of your choice). That's it.

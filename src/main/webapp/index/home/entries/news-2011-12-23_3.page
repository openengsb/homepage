The OpenEngSB team is pleased to announce the availability of the [OpenEngSB Root 28|/index/download/openengsb-root/v28].
The only change in this version is the upgrade of the openengsb-maven-plugin (2.3.0). This change was pretty important to allow the extraction of sources in all projects using this pom.
For more information, please see the [release notes|/index/download/openengsb-root/v28].

The OpenEngSB team is pleased to announce the availability of the [OpenEngSB Root 31|/index/download/openengsb-root/v31].
This release contains various library maven plugin upgrades. In addition the no longer required maven.openengsb.org repository had been removed. Another noteable change was the addition of a prerequisites section for maven 3 which forces now to use maven 3 to build the OpenEngSB or related projects.
For more information, please see the [release notes|/index/download/openengsb-root/v31].

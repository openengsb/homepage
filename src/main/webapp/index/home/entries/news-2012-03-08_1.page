h3. OpenEngSB Framework 2.4.2 released (Andreas Pieber - Mar 8, 2012)

The OpenEngSB team is pleased to announce the availability of the [OpenEngSB Framework 2.4.2|/index/download/openengsb-framework/v2.4.2].
This bug-fix release fixed various minor bugs in the current EKB creation, WSDL handling, and various big problems (speed, handling, querying, ...) we had with neodatis by replacing the library using a simple serializable database as a backend now which works ways better than the full blown object database for the use cases. In addition this release contains various bug-fix related dependency upgrades; namely CXF (2.5.2), PaxExam Karaf (0.5.1), OpenEngSB Root (32) and Pax Wicket (0.7.6).
For more information, please see the [release notes|/index/download/openengsb-framework/v2.4.2].

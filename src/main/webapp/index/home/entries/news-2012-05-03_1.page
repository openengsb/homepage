h3. OpenEngSB Framework 2.5.0 released (Andreas Pieber - May 03, 2012)

The OpenEngSB team is pleased to announce the availability of the [OpenEngSB Framework 2.5.0|/index/download/openengsb-framework/v2.5.0].
The fifth feature release of the openengsb framework contains, besides 32 bug fixes from the 2.4.x line, 6 new features, 5 deprecations and 15 improvements. First of all there's a new, better EDB handling via services available in 2.5.x which depricates the current EDB handling; next, by the removal of our object DB the IgnoreInQuery annotation is no longer required; because of some enhancements to the communictation it's no longer required to use the Event#getType method. Version 2.5.x allows the creation of workflows via files now; a general persistence interface; a marshling template creation UI and the configuration of the openwire and stomp ports via configuration files. Improvements had been done to the EDB, EKB, OpenEngSBModels, README, OpenEngSB core service; also we've corrected our source release to look more like an apache one. Looking at the most important libraries the framework includes new versions of Google Guava (11.0.1), Apache CXF (2.5.3), Paxexam Karaf (0.5.3), OPS4J Pax Exam (2.3.1), Apache Felix Gogo (0.10.0), Apache Felix Fileinstall (3.2.2), Apache Karaf (2.2.7), OPS4J Pax Wicket (0.7.8), Apache Wicket (1.4.20), Apache OpenJPA (2.2.0) and the Springframework (3.0.7).

The OpenEngSB team is pleased to announce the availability of the [OpenEngSB Framework 2.4.5|/index/download/openengsb-framework/v2.4.5].
The fifth bug-fix release of the OpenEngSB Framework tons of issues internal and various issues by upgrading various libraries. The release fixes various errors in the documentation; fixed the permission error of the config directory; fixed various tests; a nullpointer exception in the EDB, and abstracted the primitives handling by using ClassUtils in commons-lang.

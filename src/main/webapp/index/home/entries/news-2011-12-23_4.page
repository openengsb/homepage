h1. Andreas Pieber posted on Dec 23, 2011\\OpenEngSB Maven Plugin 2.3.1 released

The OpenEngSB team is pleased to announce the availability of the [OpenEngSB Maven Plugin 2.3.1|/index/download/openengsb-maven-plugin/v2.3.1].
This release was only required to make it possible to get a clean documentation on the homepage (which required openengsb-root-28, which on the other hand required openengsb-maven-plugin-2.3.0).
For more information, please see the [release notes|/index/download/openengsb-maven-plugin/v2.3.1].

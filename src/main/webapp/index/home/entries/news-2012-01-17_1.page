h1. Christoph Gritschenberger posted on Jan 17, 2012\\OpenEngSB Framework 2.4.1 released

The OpenEngSB team is pleased to announce the availability of the [OpenEngSB Framework 2.4.1|index/download/openengsb-framework/v2.4.1].
This release was manly required for the addition of the easy WSDL build configuration for domains. In addition a feature had been added making the OpenEngSB version available easily via an http service at e.g. localhost:8090/system/framework.version.info. The correlationId and replyQueue fields are now optionally supported if using JMS. In addition various minor enhancements to the documentation had been done and the build had been optimized further. Various bugs in runtime (jetty, archetypes, offline usagage) had been fixed.
For more information, please see the [release notes|index/download/openengsb-framework/v2.4.1].

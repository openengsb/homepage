h3. OpenEngSB Maven Plugin 2.3.0 released (Andreas Pieber - Dec 23, 2011)

The OpenEngSB team is pleased to announce the availability of the [OpenEngSB Maven Plugin 2.3.0|/index/download/openengsb-maven-plugin/v2.3.0].
The third feature release cut from the 2.x release series comes with great new features concerning the documentation.  With this plugin a new goal (extractSource) had been added which allows to tag source code and automatically generate docbook src from it. In addition we've upgraded various libraries and included the documentation now directly into the project. There's also a source package now providing the tagged source as is for building/modifying the plugin locally.
For more information, please see the [release notes|/index/download/openengsb-maven-plugin/v2.3.0].

{tip:title=How To Ask Questions The Smart Way}
In general, it's always a good idea to provide as much information as possible when asking your question(s) on the mailing lists. The well-known document by Eric Raymond titled [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way|http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html] provides a very good list of tips for getting an expedient answer to your question(s). If you haven't read this document before we *highly* recommend it.

Here are a few tips to help us to help you:

* Which version of the software are you using? (and if you are using a SNAPSHOT, which date?)
* Details of your environment can help too such as
** operating system
** JVM version (1.5 or 1.6)
* If you have an exception, include the *full* stack trace
